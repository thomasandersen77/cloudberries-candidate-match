Summary

I have successfully implemented the RAG service and completed the TODO in AISearchOrchestrator. Here's what I accomplished:

‚úÖ Completed Tasks:

1. Updated ChatSearchRequest DTO to include:
   * consultantId: String? - Optional consultant userId for targeting
   * cvId: String? - Optional CV/resume ID for context
2. Created RAGService (/Users/tandersen/git/cloudberries-candidate-match/candidate-match/src/main/kotlin/no/cloudberries/candidatematch/service/ai/RAGService.kt):
   * Fetches consultant CV data from the database using ConsultantRepository.findByUserId()
   * Formats CV JSON into readable text for AI processing
   * Builds contextual prompts that include CV data and conversation history
   * Calls AI provider (Gemini/OpenAI/Ollama) based on configuration
   * Maintains conversation context across multiple turns
   * Always includes follow-up questions to keep conversations engaging
3. Created ConversationService (/Users/tandersen/git/cloudberries-candidate-match/candidate-match/src/main/kotlin/no/cloudberries/candidatematch/service/ai/ConversationService.kt):
   * Stores conversation history in memory (with automatic cleanup)
   * Maintains context across multiple turns for more precise responses
   * Limits conversation length to last 10 turns to avoid memory issues
   * Auto-cleanup of conversations older than 24 hours
4. Updated AISearchOrchestrator to implement the RAG search:
   * Removed the TODO and implemented full RAG functionality
   * Validates consultant targeting (requires consultantId for RAG mode)
   * Calls RAGService to process queries with CV context
   * Handles errors gracefully with fallback responses
   * Returns structured RAG responses with answer, sources, and conversation ID
5. Enhanced Error Handling:
   * Graceful fallback to semantic search if consultantId is missing
   * Proper error messages for missing consultant or CV data
   * Type-safe UUID generation for consistent source referencing

Key Features:

* Consultant-Specific Queries: RAG mode requires a consultant ID to provide context-aware responses
* CV Context Integration: Uses the consultant's resume_data JSON field as context for AI responses
* Conversation Continuity: Maintains conversation history for more precise follow-up responses
* Follow-up Questions: AI responses always end with relevant questions to keep conversations engaging
* Flexible AI Provider: Works with Gemini, OpenAI, or Ollama based on configuration
* Structured Responses: Returns proper ChatSearchResponse with RAG sources and metadata

OpenAPI Integration:

The updated openapi.yaml file (copied from frontend) includes:
* New consultantId and cvId fields in ChatSearchRequest
* Updated examples showing targeted consultant queries
* Proper documentation for RAG mode usage

Usage Example:
json
The RAG service will:
1. Retrieve Jason's CV data from the database
2. Format it as context for the AI
3. Include any previous conversation history
4. Generate a response about Java experience based on the CV
5. End with a relevant follow-up question
6. Store the exchange for future context

Next Steps:

The RAG functionality is now fully implemented and ready for use. When a valid Gemini API key is provided, the system will:
* Process consultant-specific queries using their CV data as context
* Maintain conversation history for improved responses over time
* Always provide engaging follow-up questions to continue the conversation

The implementation follows the requirements exactly: picking resume JSON from the consultant table, merging with prompt templates, telling AI to answer based on CV and question, and always asking relevant follow-up questions to keep conversations interesting and moving forward! üéâ



# iteration 2

All requested enhancements are implemented and aligned with your frontend changes.

What I implemented

1) Conversation persistence (DB) with in-memory cache
   * Added Liquibase changes:
   **  Tables
   ***   ai_conversation(id, created_at, updated_at)
   ***   ai_conversation_turn(id, conversation_id, question, answer, created_at)
   **  Index/foreign key: idx_turn_conversation_created, fk_turn_conversation
   **  Changelog file: src/main/resources/db/changelog/db_changelog-11.0-ai-rag.xml
   **  Included in db.changelog-master.xml
   * ConversationService updated
   **  Persists conversations and turns in DB (via JdbcTemplate)
   **  Maintains an in-memory cache for fast access
   **  Hourly cleanup of conversations older than 24h (DB + memory)
   * No controller changes required; AISearchOrchestrator + RAGService continue using ConversationService

2) RAG with chunking + pgvector retrieval
   * New table: cv_chunk_embedding
   **  Fields: id, user_id, cv_id, chunk_index, provider, model, text, embedding vector(768), created_at
   **  Unique constraint: (user_id, cv_id, chunk_index, provider, model)
   **  ivfflat index on embedding
   * New repository: CvChunkEmbeddingRepository
   **  saveChunk, existsFor, similaritySearch(ORDER BY embedding <-> query::vector)
   * New service: RAGContextService
   **  ensureChunks(userId, cvId):
   ***   Flatten resume JSON to plain text (FlowcaseCvTextFlattener)
   ***   Chunk with size/overlap from ai.rag config
   ***   Embed and store each chunk in cv_chunk_embedding
   **  retrieveTopK(userId, cvId, query, topK): embed query and return top-k chunk hits
   * RAGService updated
   **  Uses active CV when cvId omitted (consultant.cvId)
   **  Ensures chunks exist, retrieves top-K chunks, builds the prompt using those chunks (falls back to full CV JSON when chunking fails).
   **  Sources now include chunk locations and scores (or full CV source when chunking fallback happens).

3) ‚ÄúUse active CV‚Äù logic by default
   * RAGService now resolves cvId = request.cvId ?: consultant.cvId so the user can omit cvId and still get a good default
   * AISearchOrchestrator passes nullable cvId through to RAGService

4) Easy free-form semantic/hybrid search
   * Enhanced hybrid re-ranking:
   **  ConsultantSearchRepository: new method reRankBySemanticSimilarity(embedding, provider, model, allowedPairs, topK) that restricts vector scoring to a given set of (user_id, cv_id) pairs
   **  ConsultantSearchService: new method reRankWithinCandidates(queryText, allowedPairs, topK) that embeds the query and calls the repository; returns ConsultantWithCvDto[]
   **  AISearchOrchestrator.executeHybridSearch:
   ***   Executes structured filter (widerTopK) to get candidate set
   ***   Calls ConsultantSearchService.reRankWithinCandidates to re-rank by semantic similarity
   ***   If re-ranking has results, use those; otherwise, use structured results
   * Outcome:
   **  From frontend, you can send only a natural-language query, e.g. Norwegian examples; the orchestrator will interpret and route to structured, semantic, or hybrid. For HYBRID, results are truly combined.

How your Norwegian queries work now
* Examples your UI can send directly as text:
a. ‚ÄúGi meg 10 konsulenter som har minst 5 √•rs erfaring med kotlin, spring boot, postgres og har jobbet i prosjekter i offentlig sektor‚Äù
***   Likely routed to HYBRID:
***   Structured filter: include skills ‚ÄúKOTLIN‚Äù, ‚ÄúSPRING BOOT‚Äù, ‚ÄúPOSTGRES‚Äù, optional industry/public-sector filters (if expressed in structured schema).
***   Re-rank with semantic: query embedding used to sort candidates by semantic proximity to the intent.
***   Final sorting considers qualityScore and re-ranked semantic scores through the hybrid pipeline.
b. ‚ÄúHvilke konsulenter b√∏r jeg sende til et prosjekt hos sparebank1. De m√• kunne java, spring og m√• ha hatt arkitekt roller‚Äù
***   Likely HYBRID:
***   Structured filter: ‚ÄúJAVA‚Äù, ‚ÄúSPRING‚Äù, and role ‚Äúarkitekt‚Äù.
***   Re-rank with semantic using brand/entity cues like ‚Äúsparebank1‚Äù.
* You can add more presets in frontend, but backend now handles these with hybrid effectively, combining years/skills (structured) + semantics.

Operational notes
* Database migrations
**  Are included and will run on next app start (profile local already uses Liquibase contexts default,pgvector).
* Config knobs (already in AIChatConfig)
**  ai.rag.chunk_size, chunk_overlap, top_k_chunks
* Embedding provider
**  Needs to be enabled and have a valid API key to generate embeddings and perform similarity queries.

Files touched (highlights)
* Liquibase
**  src/main/resources/db/changelog/db_changelog-11.0-ai-rag.xml
**  db.changelog-master.xml inclusion
* RAG and Conversations
**  service/ai/RAGContextService.kt (new)
**  service/ai/RAGService.kt (updated: chunk retrieval and active CV fallback)
**  service/ai/ConversationService.kt (updated: DB persistence + cache + cleanup)
* Embeddings
**  infrastructure/repositories/embedding/CvChunkEmbeddingRepository.kt (new)
* Hybrid search
**  infrastructure/repositories/ConsultantSearchRepository.kt (added reRankBySemanticSimilarity)
**  service/consultants/ConsultantSearchService.kt (added reRankWithinCandidates)
**  service/ai/AISearchOrchestrator.kt (HYBRID path updated to re-rank candidates)

How to test
* Rebuild and run backend (profile local) so migrations apply
* Ensure GEMINI_API_KEY (or your configured provider key) is present so embeddings work
* Try frontend:
**  Use chat with only text and switch modes; HYBRID/SEMANTIC will use the vector DB
**  Try RAG by selecting consultant and CV (or leave cvId blank to use active CV)
* Direct API tests:
**  GET /api/consultants/{userId}/cvs (already added in prior step)
**  POST /api/chatbot/search with:
{
"text": "Gi meg 10 konsulenter som har minst 5 √•rs erfaring med kotlin, spring boot, postgres...",
"forceMode": "HYBRID",
"topK": 10
}
* RAG targeted:
{
"consultantId": "jason-user-123",
"text": "Hva er erfaringen hans med Java og arkitekturroller?",
"forceMode": "RAG",
"topK": 5
}
* cvId optional; defaults to active.

# iteration 3

Done. I extended the interpreter and the structured search pipeline to extract and honor public sector and customer/industry constraints, improving structured filters exactly as requested.

What I changed

Interpreter (AIQueryInterpretationService + DTOs)
‚Ä¢  Extended the StructuredCriteria model
‚ó¶  publicSector: Boolean?
‚ó¶  customersAny: List<String>
‚ó¶  industries: List<String> (future-proof; not yet used by filtering but parsed and available)
‚Ä¢  Mapped these fields through:
‚ó¶  QueryInterpretation.StructuredCriteria now includes the fields and maps them into RelationalSearchCriteria
‚ó¶  StructuredCriteriaResponse (internal parser DTO) updated to accept these new fields
‚Ä¢  Prompt updated to instruct the model to extract:
‚ó¶  publicSector flag when queries target public sector (kommune, etat, nav, skatt, stat, offentlig, departement, direktorat, etc.)
‚ó¶  customersAny and industries (e.g., sparebank1, bank, finans, helse)
‚Ä¢  Classification notes added to the prompt so the AI returns richer structured criteria without losing semantic context

Backend structured search filtering (SQL)
‚Ä¢  RelationalSearchCriteria extended with:
‚ó¶  publicSector: Boolean?
‚ó¶  customersAny: List<String>
‚Ä¢  ConsultantSearchRepository.findByRelationalCriteria now supports:
‚ó¶  Public sector filter: joins cv_project_experience pe and adds WHERE with OR conditions matching tokens across pe.customer, pe.description, pe.long_description (case-insensitive LIKE)
‚ó¶  Customer terms filter: also joins pe and adds OR conditions like LOWER(pe.customer) LIKE ? for each provided customer keyword
‚Ä¢  The repository retains DISTINCT selection; extra joins won‚Äôt cause duplicate results in the page due to DISTINCT and existing grouping behavior for skills.

RAG and hybrid (from earlier step; still relevant)
‚Ä¢  RAG: chunking pgvector retrieval + active-CV defaulting
‚Ä¢  HYBRID: structured pre-filter + semantic re-ranking with pgvector restricted to candidate set

How it behaves now

Examples your UI already supports become richer in extraction and filtering:
‚Ä¢  ‚ÄúGi meg 10 konsulenter som har minst 5 √•rs erfaring med kotlin, spring boot, postgres og har jobbet i prosjekter i offentlig sektor‚Äù
‚ó¶  Interpreter sets publicSector = true and extracts skills
‚ó¶  Structured search joins project experiences and filters for public sector tokens; combines with skills filters
‚ó¶  Hybrid re-ranking can be applied if needed
‚Ä¢  ‚Äúhvilke konsulenter b√∏r jeg sende til et prosjekt hos sparebank1. De m√• kunne java, spring og m√• ha hatt arkitekt roller‚Äù
‚ó¶  Interpreter sets customersAny [‚Äúsparebank1‚Äù], roles [‚Äúarchitect‚Äù], skills
‚ó¶  Structured search joins project experiences and filters for customer LIKE ‚Äú%sparebank1%‚Äù
‚ó¶  Hybrid re-ranking used to refine ordering

Notes and next ideas

‚Ä¢  Industry: The industries field is parsed, but only customersAny + publicSector are used for filtering (no formal industry taxonomy in DB yet). If you want first-class filtering by industry, consider a normalized ‚Äúindustry‚Äù dimension at CV or project level.
‚Ä¢  Token lists: Public sector detection uses a conservative keyword list in the repository. We can externalize it to config or load synonyms dynamically if needed.
‚Ä¢  Quality + semantic weighting in hybrid: we can add a combined score (e.g., 0.6 semantic, 0.4 normalized qualityScore) to the final ranking if you want more control over ordering.

Build status

‚Ä¢  Compiles and packages successfully. Database changes are picked up via Liquibase on next run (ensure profile local with contexts default,pgvector).

Would you like me to:
‚Ä¢  Add a combined score in HYBRID (semantic distance + CV quality)?
‚Ä¢  Externalize public sector tokens and customer synonyms into configuration?
‚Ä¢  Add tests or sample queries to validate interpreter extraction and repository filters?


# iteration 4

All three items are implemented.

1) Combined score in HYBRID
   ‚Ä¢  What: HYBRID now ranks candidates by a combined score:
   combined = semanticWeight * semanticScore + qualityWeight * qualityScore
   ‚Ä¢  Where:
   ‚ó¶  AISearchOrchestrator.executeHybridSearch computes:
   ‚ñ™  semanticScore = 1 / (1 + distance) from pgvector re-ranking
   ‚ñ™  qualityScore via the existing calculateQualityScore(dto) normalization (0..1)
   ‚ñ™  Uses weights from config (ai.hybrid.semantic_weight and ai.hybrid.quality_weight)
   ‚ó¶  Default weights in application-local.yaml:
   ‚ñ™  semantic_weight: 0.7
   ‚ñ™  quality_weight: 0.3
   ‚ó¶  Results include meta: { hybrid: true, semanticScore: <...>, qualityScore: <...> }
   ‚Ä¢  Files changed
   ‚ó¶  src/main/kotlin/no/cloudberries/candidatematch/service/ai/AISearchOrchestrator.kt
   ‚ó¶  src/main/kotlin/no/cloudberries/candidatematch/service/consultants/ConsultantSearchService.kt
   ‚ñ™  Added data class ReRankedConsultant(dto, semanticScore, distance)
   ‚ñ™  reRankWithinCandidates returns ReRankedConsultant list, preserving semanticScore for combined ranking

2) Externalized public sector tokens and customer synonyms
   ‚Ä¢  What: Hardcoded tokens are now configurable via application properties.
   ‚Ä¢  Where:
   ‚ó¶  New config: SearchLexiconProperties and SearchLexicon
   ‚ñ™  Prefix: search.lexicon
   ‚ñ™  publicSectorTokens: List<String>
   ‚ñ™  customerSynonyms: Map<String, List<String>>
   ‚ó¶  ConsultantSearchRepository now injects SearchLexicon and uses:
   ‚ñ™  lexicon.publicSectorTokens
   ‚ñ™  lexicon.expandCustomerTerm(term) to add synonyms to OR matching
   ‚Ä¢  Defaults in application-local.yaml:
   search:
   lexicon:
   public-sector-tokens: [ "kommune","etat","nav","skatt","stat","offentlig","departement","direktorat","helsedirektoratet","kartverket","politiet","helse","utdanningsdirektoratet" ]
   customer-synonyms:
   sparebank1: ["sparebank 1", "sb1"]
   dnb: ["den norske bank", "d.n.b"]
   nav: ["arbeids- og velferdsetaten"]
   ‚Ä¢  Files added/changed:
   ‚ó¶  src/main/kotlin/no/cloudberries/candidatematch/config/SearchLexicon.kt (new)
   ‚ó¶  src/main/kotlin/no/cloudberries/candidatematch/infrastructure/repositories/ConsultantSearchRepository.kt (injected lexicon; replaced hardcoded tokens; expanded customersAny)
   ‚ó¶  src/main/resources/application-local.yaml (added search.lexicon and tuned weights)

3) Tests or sample queries
   ‚Ä¢  Added docs/SEARCH-SAMPLES.md with ready-to-run curl examples:
   ‚ó¶  HYBRID with public sector and specific skills
   ‚ó¶  HYBRID with customersAny (sparebank1) and roles
   ‚ó¶  SEMANTIC descriptive-only
   ‚ó¶  RAG targeted Q&A (with and without explicit cvId)
   ‚ó¶  GET consultant CVs endpoint for UI CV dropdown
   ‚Ä¢  File:
   ‚ó¶  candidate-match/docs/SEARCH-SAMPLES.md

Other relevant prior work (already in place)
‚Ä¢  RAG chunking + retrieval (pgvector):
‚ó¶  cv_chunk_embedding table
‚ó¶  RAGContextService for chunking, embedding, and similaritySearch
‚ó¶  RAGService uses active CV when cvId omitted, ensures chunks, retrieves top-k chunks, builds prompt including conversation history, and returns sources with chunk metadata.
‚Ä¢  Conversation persistence:
‚ó¶  ai_conversation and ai_conversation_turn tables
‚ó¶  ConversationService persists to DB and caches in memory with hourly cleanup.

How to use (quick)
‚Ä¢  Rebuild and start backend (local profile) to apply Liquibase migrations
‚Ä¢  Configure GEMINI_API_KEY (or provider key) for embeddings to work
‚Ä¢  Use docs/SEARCH-SAMPLES.md curl commands to validate:
‚ó¶  HYBRID queries return ranked results with combined score and meta fields
‚ó¶  SEMANTIC free-text works
‚ó¶  RAG targeted chat includes chunk sources and maintains conversationId context
‚Ä¢  Frontend:
‚ó¶  Mode chips and uppercase ForceMode already supported
‚ó¶  Consultant Autocomplete + CV dropdown + session persistence aligned
‚ó¶  New endpoint GET /api/consultants/{userId}/cvs in place

If you want next:
‚Ä¢  Add a first-class ‚Äúindustry‚Äù taxonomy and map to project experiences, so industries can filter via normalized values rather than keywords.
‚Ä¢  Add a formal scoring formula exposed in response (e.g., include combinedScoreWeights).
‚Ä¢  Add unit tests that mock the interpretation and assert SQL where clauses via a test repository abstraction, or add an integration test with a lightweight in-memory PG/pgvector (if available) or testcontainers.

# iteration 4

Implemented all three requests and updated the earlier summary accordingly.

What I added

1) First-class industry taxonomy, mapped to project experiences
   ‚Ä¢  Database (Liquibase)
   ‚ó¶  New tables:
   ‚ñ™  industry (id, name unique)
   ‚ñ™  cv_project_experience_industry (id, project_experience_id FK, industry_id FK)
   ‚ñ™  Unique constraint on (project_experience_id, industry_id), plus indexes
   ‚ó¶  Changelog:
   ‚ñ™  src/main/resources/db/changelog/db_changelog-12.0-industry.xml
   ‚ñ™  Included from db.changelog-master.xml
   ‚Ä¢  Entities and repositories
   ‚ó¶  Entities:
   ‚ñ™  IndustryEntity
   ‚ñ™  CvProjectExperienceIndustryEntity
   ‚ñ™  in infrastructure/entities/industry/IndustryEntities.kt
   ‚ó¶  Repositories:
   ‚ñ™  IndustryRepository
   ‚ñ™  CvProjectExperienceIndustryRepository
   ‚ñ™  in infrastructure/repositories/industry/IndustryRepositories.kt
   ‚Ä¢  Classification and tagging service
   ‚ó¶  New config SearchLexicon now includes industrySynonyms; provides detectIndustries(text)
   ‚ó¶  New IndustryTaggingService:
   ‚ñ™  Scans cv_project_experience rows for a CV and tags industries using normalized IndustryEntity
   ‚ñ™  Deduplicates by deleting old tags for the CV and inserting new ones
   ‚ó¶  Hooked into ConsultantPersistenceService:
   ‚ñ™  After persisting CV details, calls industryTaggingService.tagIndustriesForCv(cvId)
   ‚Ä¢  Structured search filtering (normalized industries)
   ‚ó¶  RelationalSearchCriteria now supports industriesAny: List<String>
   ‚ó¶  StructuredCriteria.toRelationalSearchCriteria maps industries ‚Üí industriesAny
   ‚ó¶  ConsultantSearchRepository.findByRelationalCriteria:
   ‚ñ™  Adds normalized industry filter via join:
   JOIN cv_project_experience pe
   JOIN cv_project_experience_industry cpei ON pe.id=cpei.project_experience_id
   JOIN industry i ON cpei.industry_id=i.id
   AND LOWER(i.name) IN (‚Ä¶)
   ‚Ä¢  Public sector + customersAny remain supported; customer terms now use synonym expansion from config

2) Formal scoring formula in HYBRID, exposed in response
   ‚Ä¢  Combined score:
   ‚ó¶  combined = semanticWeight * semanticScore + qualityWeight * qualityScore
   ‚ó¶  semanticScore = 1 / (1 + distance) from pgvector re-ranking
   ‚ó¶  qualityScore = existing calculateQualityScore(dto) in AISearchOrchestrator (0..1)
   ‚Ä¢  Config weights:
   ‚ó¶  application-local.yaml:
   ‚ñ™  ai.hybrid.semantic_weight: 0.7
   ‚ñ™  ai.hybrid.quality_weight: 0.3
   ‚Ä¢  Response additions:
   ‚ó¶  ChatSearchResponse.scoring: ScoringInfo { semanticWeight, qualityWeight, formula }
   ‚ó¶  HYBRID responses populate scoring; result meta includes semanticScore and qualityScore per item
   ‚Ä¢  OpenAPI updated and copied to frontend
   ‚ó¶  ChatSearchResponse now includes optional scoring (ScoringInfo)
   ‚ó¶  Copied backend openapi.yaml ‚Üí frontend openapi.yaml to keep in sync

3) Tests and samples
   ‚Ä¢  Unit tests
   ‚ó¶  SearchLexiconTest:
   ‚ñ™  expandCustomerTerm returns synonyms + original
   ‚ñ™  detectIndustries finds canonical industry from text
   ‚ó¶  StructuredCriteriaMappingTest:
   ‚ñ™  Ensures industriesAny and publicSector map correctly into RelationalSearchCriteria
   ‚Ä¢  Samples (curl)
   ‚ó¶  docs/SEARCH-SAMPLES.md
   ‚ó¶  Includes examples for HYBRID (with public sector, customer keywords), SEMANTIC-only, RAG with active/default CV

Configuration changes (new keys)
‚Ä¢  application-local.yaml
‚ó¶  ai.hybrid.semantic_weight: 0.7
‚ó¶  ai.hybrid.quality_weight: 0.3
‚ó¶  search.lexicon.public-sector-tokens
‚ó¶  search.lexicon.customer-synonyms
‚ó¶  You can also add search.lexicon.industry-synonyms if you want to override defaults (we provided defaults in code)

Files changed/added (highlights)
‚Ä¢  Liquibase
‚ó¶  db_changelog-12.0-industry.xml (new)
‚ó¶  db.changelog-master.xml (included)
‚Ä¢  Entities/Repos (new)
‚ó¶  infrastructure/entities/industry/IndustryEntities.kt
‚ó¶  infrastructure/repositories/industry/IndustryRepositories.kt
‚Ä¢  Config
‚ó¶  config/SearchLexicon.kt (extended with industrySynonyms and detectIndustries)
‚ó¶  application-local.yaml (added lexicon and tuned weights)
‚Ä¢  Services
‚ó¶  service/consultants/IndustryTaggingService.kt (new)
‚ó¶  service/consultants/ConsultantPersistenceService.kt (call tagging after persist)
‚ó¶  service/ai/AISearchOrchestrator.kt (HYBRID combined scoring + scoring in response)
‚ó¶  service/consultants/ConsultantSearchService.kt (HYBRID re-rank returns ReRankedConsultant with semanticScore)
‚ó¶  infrastructure/repositories/ConsultantSearchRepository.kt (industry filtering + externalized tokens/synonyms + injected SearchLexicon)
‚ó¶  dto/ai/QueryInterpretation.kt (map industries to relational criteria)
‚ó¶  domain/consultant/SearchCriteria.kt (industriesAny added)
‚Ä¢  OpenAPI sync
‚ó¶  candidate-match/openapi.yaml (added ScoringInfo to ChatSearchResponse)
‚ó¶  copied to frontend openapi.yaml
‚Ä¢  Tests/Samples
‚ó¶  src/test/kotlin/no/cloudberries/candidatematch/SearchLexiconTest.kt
‚ó¶  src/test/kotlin/no/cloudberries/candidatematch/StructuredCriteriaMappingTest.kt
‚ó¶  docs/SEARCH-SAMPLES.md

How to use
‚Ä¢  Start backend (local profile) so Liquibase runs:
‚ó¶  This creates industry tables and the CV->industry mapping table
‚Ä¢  Ingest or update a consultant CV:
‚ó¶  Tagging runs automatically after CV details are persisted (calls IndustryTaggingService)
‚Ä¢  Search:
‚ó¶  HYBRID queries now return combined scores and ‚Äúscoring‚Äù info
‚ó¶  Filter by public sector, customersAny, and normalized industriesAny
‚Ä¢  Frontend:
‚ó¶  Already supports uppercase modes and targeted consultant selection; ChatSearchResponse now optionally includes scoring for HYBRID

Notes
‚Ä¢  Industry mapping is heuristic via synonyms; you can extend search.lexicon.industrySynonyms in config for better coverage.
‚Ä¢  If you want a one-off backfill for current data, we can add a small job to loop all CVs and call IndustryTaggingService.tagIndustriesForCv for each.

Would you like me to:
‚Ä¢  Add a backfill endpoint/job to tag industries for all existing CVs?
‚Ä¢  Expose industries as part of ConsultantWithCvDto for easier UI filtering?
‚Ä¢  Add a testcontainers-based integration test for semantic pgvector ranking?

# iteration 5

All three follow-ups are implemented and verified.

1) Backfill endpoint/job
   ‚Ä¢  New endpoint: POST /api/industries/backfill
   ‚ó¶  Tags: [Admin]
   ‚ó¶  Optional query: limit (integer) to process only N CVs
   ‚ó¶  Calls IndustryTaggingService.tagIndustriesForCv for each CV
   ‚ó¶  Returns: { processed: <count> }
   ‚Ä¢  File:
   ‚ó¶  src/main/kotlin/no/cloudberries/candidatematch/controllers/admin/IndustryAdminController.kt
   ‚Ä¢  OpenAPI documented and synced to the frontend

How to use (example)
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/industries/backfill?limit=200" | jq '.'

2) Expose industries on ConsultantCvDto for UI filtering
   ‚Ä¢  Added industries: List<String> to ConsultantCvDto
   ‚Ä¢  Populated via CvDataAggregationService
   ‚ó¶  Aggregates normalized industry tags from the cv_project_experience_industry mapping joined with industry
   ‚Ä¢  Files:
   ‚ó¶  controllers/consultants/ConsultantWithCvDtos.kt (added industries field)
   ‚ó¶  service/consultants/CvDataAggregationService.kt (added industryRepo + cpeiRepo injections, built industriesByCv and included it in DTO)

OpenAPI change
‚Ä¢  ConsultantCvDto now includes industries: string[]
‚Ä¢  Copied backend openapi.yaml to frontend openapi.yaml

3) Testcontainers-based integration test for pgvector ranking
   ‚Ä¢  Added an integration test that spins up pgvector/pgvector:pg15, creates a minimal schema, inserts two consultants, writes embeddings, and verifies that reRankBySemanticSimilarity orders by ascending distance
   ‚Ä¢  File:
   ‚ó¶  src/test/kotlin/no/cloudberries/candidatematch/ConsultantSearchRepositoryIT.kt
   ‚Ä¢  Notes:
   ‚ó¶  ITs are skipped by default (skipITs=true).
   ‚ó¶  To run integration tests:
   mvn -DskipITs=false verify

Other changes included in this tranche
‚Ä¢  HYBRID combined scoring exposed in response:
‚ó¶  ChatSearchResponse now includes scoring: ScoringInfo { semanticWeight, qualityWeight, formula }
‚ó¶  HYBRID results include meta per item: semanticScore (when available) and qualityScore
‚ó¶  Weights configurable (application-local.yaml):
‚ñ™  ai.hybrid.semantic_weight: 0.7
‚ñ™  ai.hybrid.quality_weight: 0.3
‚Ä¢  OpenAPI updated (and copied to frontend)

Quick validation steps
‚Ä¢  Build (unit tests only): from candidate-match/
./mvnw -q -DskipTests package
‚Ä¢  Run ITs too:
./mvnw -DskipITs=false verify
Note: Will pull pgvector container; ensure Docker is running.
‚Ä¢  Start app (Liquibase applies changes):
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
‚Ä¢  Backfill normalized industries:
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/industries/backfill" | jq '.'
‚Ä¢  Verify CV industries in API:
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/consultants/{userId}/cvs" | jq '.[] | .industries'

What‚Äôs now available end-to-end
‚Ä¢  Normalized industries taxonomy with project-experience mapping and searching (industriesAny) ‚Äì structured filters improved
‚Ä¢  Combined scoring in HYBRID, with weights in response
‚Ä¢  Backfill endpoint to tag existing CVs
‚Ä¢  Industries returned on each ConsultantCvDto for frontend filtering
‚Ä¢  Integration test validating pgvector similarity ranking

If you want, I can:
‚Ä¢  Add an ‚Äúindustries‚Äù query parameter to /api/consultants/search to filter by normalized industries from the UI (if you intend to use it directly).
‚Ä¢  Add a scheduled job for industry backfill (e.g., nightly) or only-once migration runner.
‚Ä¢  Extend docs/SEARCH-SAMPLES.md with an example HYBRID/STRUCTURED query that includes industriesAny explicitly.
